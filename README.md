# morph-me
A shape morphing library

[DEMO](http://www.amituslab.com/github/MorphMe/examples/morph-me.html) 

MorphMe(Work in progress!) allows you to morph dom elements to containers. The unique features of MorphMe are that it allows you to morph elements with different shapes such as rectangle, circle, hexagon, polygon, triangle and other shape which is tough to customise otherwise. It also allows you to use different morphing effects according to the application.

## How to use

You can initialize the MorphMe library with following function:

MorphMe(sourceElement,targetElement,elementShape,morphEffect);

Example:

```javascript
new MorphMe(document.getElementById('source'),document.getElementById('target'),'rectangle','simple');
```

More Shapes and effects coming soon!!!
